# Workground

Temporary home for rebuilding of [Groundwork](https://github.com/growdigital/groundwork). Itâ€™s a pun on playground and also one of those compound words with the words swapped over.

Copy of default `static-site` Metalsmith example from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/tree/master/examples/static-site).

# static-site

This example uses Metalsmith to make a static site. To test it out yourself just run:

    $ make build
